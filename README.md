## Project Overview

This project implements a fine-tuned CodeLlama-7B model to provide structured, educational code feedback for programming students. Unlike generic AI tools that prioritize productivity, this system is explicitly designed for education, balancing correctness, pedagogy, and ethical safeguards.

## Problem Statement

Current programming education faces several challenges:
- **High dropout rates** due to lack of immediate feedback
- **Inefficient feedback loops** with limited instructor availability
- **Lack of personalized learning** experiences
- **Limited instructor bandwidth** for one-on-one guidance
- **Over-reliance on AI tools** without deeper comprehension

## Solution

Our fine-tuned CodeLlama-7B model provides:

1. **Instant, actionable reviews** with specific suggestions
2. **Beginner-friendly explanations** tailored to skill level
3. **Personalized adaptation** based on inferred student level
4. **Educational focus** with learning objectives
5. **Ethical safeguards** against over-reliance

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Code Review**: Comprehensive analysis of student code
- **Educational Feedback**: Constructive guidance for learning
- **Skill Level Adaptation**: Adjusts feedback complexity
- **Learning Objectives**: Maps feedback to educational goals
- **Fallback Analysis**: Rule-based backup when model fails

### Educational Features
- **Syntax Error Detection**: Identifies and explains syntax issues
- **Logic Error Analysis**: Finds logical problems in code
- **Optimization Suggestions**: Recommends efficiency improvements
- **Style Guidance**: Promotes best practices and readability
- **Concept Explanations**: Provides educational context

## üéØ Comprehensive Feedback System

The system provides **5-stage educational feedback**:

1. **üìä Analysis**: Strengths, weaknesses, and issues
2. **üìù Step-by-Step Guide**: Detailed improvement instructions
3. **üéì Learning Points**: Key concepts to understand
4. **‚ùì Comprehension Quiz**: Interactive learning check
5. **üîß Code Fix**: Improved version with explanations

## üöÄ Deployment Options

### Option 1: Hugging Face Spaces (Recommended)
1. **Fork this repository** to your GitHub account
2. **Create a new Space** on Hugging Face:
   - Go to [huggingface.co/spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces)
   - Click "Create new Space"
   - Choose "Streamlit" as SDK
   - Connect your GitHub repository
3. **Upload your fine-tuned model** to the Space
4. **Deploy automatically** - HF Spaces will handle the rest!

### Option 2: Local Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd programming-education-ai
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure your model path**:
   - Update `config.py` with your fine-tuned model path
   - Or set environment variable: `export FINETUNED_MODEL_PATH="path/to/your/model"`

## Usage

### Web Interface (Recommended)
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### Command Line
```bash
python fine.py
```

### Example Usage
```python
from fine import ProgrammingEducationAI

# Initialize with your fine-tuned model
ai_tutor = ProgrammingEducationAI("path/to/your/finetuned/model")
ai_tutor.load_model()

# Analyze student code
student_code = """
def find_duplicates(numbers):
    x = []
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        for j in range(i+1, len(numbers)):
            if numbers[i] == numbers[j]:
                x.append(numbers[i])
    return x
"""

# Get comprehensive feedback
feedback = ai_tutor.generate_comprehensive_feedback(student_code, "beginner")
```

## Model Architecture

### Fine-tuned CodeLlama-7B
- **Base Model**: CodeLlama-7B
- **Fine-tuning Datasets**: 
  - Code review dataset
  - Code feedback dataset
- **Training Focus**: Educational feedback generation
- **Output Format**: Structured, pedagogical responses

### Prompt Templates

The model uses specialized prompt templates for educational feedback:

1. **Comprehensive Analysis Template**
2. **Comprehension Question Template**
3. **Code Fix Template**

## Configuration

Edit `config.py` to customize:

- **Model parameters** (temperature, max tokens, etc.)
- **Student levels** and their characteristics
- **Feedback types** and learning objectives
- **Ethical safeguards** and educational policies

## Dataset Information

### Training Datasets
- **Code Review Dataset**: Contains code samples with expert reviews
- **Code Feedback Dataset**: Contains educational feedback examples

### Dataset Format
```json
{
  "code": "student_code_here",
  "level": "beginner|intermediate|advanced",
  "feedback": "educational_feedback_here",
  "feedback_type": "syntax|logic|optimization|style|explanation",
  "learning_objectives": ["objective1", "objective2"]
}
```

## Ethical Considerations

### Safeguards Implemented
- **Prevent Over-reliance**: Encourages understanding over copy-paste
- **Encourage Learning**: Provides explanations, not just solutions
- **Provide Alternatives**: Suggests multiple approaches
- **Promote Best Practices**: Emphasizes good coding habits

### Educational Focus
- **Structured Feedback**: Organized by learning objectives
- **Progressive Complexity**: Adapts to student skill level
- **Concept Explanations**: Teaches underlying principles
- **Constructive Criticism**: Positive reinforcement with improvement suggestions

## Evaluation Metrics

### Educational Effectiveness
- **Learning Outcome Improvement**: Student performance metrics
- **Feedback Quality**: Relevance and helpfulness ratings
- **Engagement Metrics**: Student interaction patterns
- **Retention Rates**: Long-term learning retention

### Technical Performance
