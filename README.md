# 🎓 Generative AI for Programming Education

## 🚀 Live Demo
**Hugging Face Spaces**: [Coming Soon - Deploy using DEPLOYMENT.md guide]

## 📋 Problem Statement
Current programming education struggles with high dropout rates, inefficient feedback loops, and a lack of personalized learning—problems exacerbated by limited instructor bandwidth. While Generative AI (e.g., Copilot, ChatGPT) can help, most tools prioritize productivity over learning, offering code solutions without explanations or tailored guidance. This risks student over-reliance without deeper comprehension.

## 🎯 Solution
To address this gap, we fine-tuned **CodeLlama-7B** to provide structured, educational code feedback—not just correct answers. Our model analyzes student code and delivers:

- **Instant, actionable reviews** (e.g., "This loop can be optimized from O(n²) to O(n) using a hashmap")
- **Beginner-friendly explanations** (e.g., "In Python, list.append() modifies the list in-place but returns None—that's why your print() shows None")
- **Personalized adaptation** (e.g., adjusting feedback depth based on inferred skill level)

Unlike generic AI tools, our system is explicitly designed for education, balancing correctness, pedagogy, and ethical safeguards against over-reliance.

## ✨ Features

### 🧠 **Fine-tuned CodeLlama-7B Model**
- Trained on **code review** and **code feedback** datasets

- **Multi-stage feedback generation**

## 🎯 Usage Examples

### **Input Code**
```python
def find_duplicates(numbers):
    x = []
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        for j in range(i+1, len(numbers)):
            if numbers[i] == numbers[j]:
                x.append(numbers[i])
    return x
```

### **Generated Feedback**
