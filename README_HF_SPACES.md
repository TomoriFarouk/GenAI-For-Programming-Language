# AI Programming Tutor - Hugging Face Spaces Deployment

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

This is a simplified version of the AI Programming Tutor designed to work reliably on Hugging Face Spaces.

### Files for Deployment:

- **`app.py`** - Super simple version (20 lines) - **RECOMMENDED**
- **`streamlit_app.py`** - Full featured version (109 lines)
- **`requirements.txt`** - Only Streamlit dependency
- **`.streamlit/config.toml`** - Minimal configuration

### Deployment Steps:

1. **Upload to Hugging Face Spaces**
   - Create new Space
   - Choose "Streamlit" as SDK
   - Upload these files

2. **Use `app.py` for guaranteed success**
   - Only 20 lines of code
   - No complex dependencies
   - Works immediately

3. **Alternative: Use `streamlit_app.py`**
   - More features and better UI
   - Tabbed interface
   - Still minimal and reliable

### Features:

- âœ… **Code Analysis**: Enter Python code for feedback
- âœ… **Strengths & Weaknesses**: Identify what's good and what needs improvement
- âœ… **Step-by-Step Improvements**: Clear guidance on how to improve
- âœ… **Learning Points**: Key concepts to understand
- âœ… **Comprehension Questions**: Test your understanding
- âœ… **Code Fixes**: See improved versions

### Demo Mode:

The app currently runs in demo mode, providing structured educational feedback without requiring the fine-tuned model. This ensures it works immediately on Hugging Face Spaces.

### Future Enhancement:

To add the fine-tuned model:
1. Upload model to Hugging Face Model Hub
2. Add HF_TOKEN to Spaces secrets
3. Update the app to use the model
